,City Sightseeing Saigon,,0.0,,,"City Sightseeing was created in 1999 in Seville, Spain and this tour is still the back bone of our worldwide operations. Starting with just four tours in 2000 and initially as a joint venture between UK based Ensign Bus and newly established City Sightseeing Spain, City Sightseeing is now a well-known feature in almost 100 locations worldwide which span six of the seven continents. Our bright, cheerful and fun-filled red open top buses are sought after by tourists and visitors to some of the world’s top destinations. Saigon is an amazing mix of cultures. Founded over fifteen centuries ago, it didn’t become an important city until the arrival of Vietnamese settlers from the north in the 17th century. Colonisation by the French 200 years later saw a European influence that lasted some hundred years. Independence came via two long and bloody wars that also left their mark. With your Hop-On Hop-Off Bus Ticket, you’ll be able to discover every stunning facet of Saigon. And you can choose between our Saigon City Tour (Red Line) and our Chinatown Tour (Blue Line). Hop on the bus at any of our stops and then decide where to hop off first.",,5.59,https://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/1lo6912000m2xkfip9285.png,0:00,23:59,"10.776629, 106.702763",

It closes twice a week and the time you can visit is limited. Please dress appropriately and avoid shorts, sleeveless clothes, it is safer. Big bags etc are not allowed, mobile phones must also be turned off and no photography is allowed inside. This mausoleum is located in a vast land with multiple attractions around it, like a pagoda. We had goose bumps when we approached the mausoleum and we were very disappointed because they did not allow any tourists to approach for some reason. The worst part was that it was our last day in Hanoi so we missed seeing the president, but we were glad to at least reach the gate. An English-speaking and knowledgeable guide can help tourists quickly navigate this vast land. This is a must visit place!","The Guanyin Temple is a Chinese-style Buddhist temple located on Laozi Street, Embankment, District 5, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Founded in the 19th century, the monastery is dedicated to Guanyin, but also has tablets of traditional Chinese religions such as Taoism, such as Mazu, an influential Chinese community in Fujian, Guangdong and Southeast Asia. The temple plaques mainly use Chinese characters. At the beginning of its establishment, the temple was dedicated to Our Lady of Heaven, and later dedicated to Guanyin Bodhisattva, so it was later renamed the Guanyin Temple. The roof is decorated with tiles of various scenes, all from the plots of traditional Chinese dramas and stories. The front door of the temple is also decorated with ancient gold lacquer panels.",,0.0,https://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/100d1f000001goumc67C3.jpg,0:00,23:59,"10.754133, 106.659625",

The art is impressive but some of the art can't be seen in 3D. We spent an hour there plus the tour time and took some nice photos. Will probably visit this museum a second time in the future. The photos turned out really nice. It was a bit like a taxi ride but we were relieved to think that taxis in Ho Chi Minh City are cheap. We spent about an hour here and would recommend it if you are interested after seeing some photos of this place.,"The works displayed in the Ho Chi Minh 3D Museum allow visitors' senses to reflect three-dimensional objects or scenes through 'optical illusions', and guests can take pictures in 2D and 3D art and sculpture works.

Someone recommended this place to us but no one at our hotel seemed to know about it. No problem though, we showed the taxi driver the address and they took us there. Like others have said, you watch a short video and then you get a private tour. This building is unique. Originally built in Hanoi and now it has been transported to Ho Chi Minh City. Our guide was great. She spent a lot of time explaining everything and answering our questions. She also asked us questions and made everything interactive. She had us dress up in costumes and pretend to grind medicine and be doctors and patients. I know it sounds a bit boring but it was really fun. It was really interesting as a comparative view of western medicine. Highly recommend a visit here. Also, it is almost free for tourists to visit.","The museum has 6 floors and 18 exhibition rooms, displaying nearly 3,000 items related to traditional Vietnamese medicine, including animal and plant specimens, pharmaceutical utensils, medical books, etc., which can be traced back to the Stone Age. Fito Museum has now become a very attractive tourist destination in Ho Chi Minh City. Its charm lies in the fact that tourists can make medicine by themselves and learn the common sense of using medical treatment.",,6.58,https://ak-d.tripcdn.com/images/0101112000d8j74uwEB4B.jpg,0:00,23:59,"10.776182, 106.671888",
